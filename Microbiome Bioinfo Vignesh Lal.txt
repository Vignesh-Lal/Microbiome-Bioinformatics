From here are the answers to the worksheet!
(All screenshots are included on the word document/pdf)
1) Examine the metadata file. What columns do you see that you think might be useful for later when doing alpha and beta diversity metrics? HINT: there are 3
# The columns that will be used will be 
2) Include a screenshot of your interactive quality plot. Based on this plot, what values would you choose for --p-trunc-len and --p-trim-left for both the forward and reverse reads? Why have you chosen those numbers? HINT: If you trim and truncate too much, you will lose too many of your reads, making your downstream analysis not useful. Think about it scientifically and only trim and truncate where the overall quality averages below 25-30.
# The truncking value I used was 249 and trimming of 50 for the forward reads and the reverse reads had a trunck of 190 and trim of 27. 

3) Include a screenshot of the table summary from visualizing your table and a screenshot of the sequence length statistics from the rep-seqs file. Remember, we may eventually want to cut any samples with less than 10,000 reads. Do you see any in the interactive sample detail that might need to be cut? If so, which ones?
# The value I choose for the program to ignore and below was the number 8,702 since everything above this number seemed too be good and I was advised that limiting too much can lead to low quality analysis for the data given.

4) Once you have generated your taxonomy visualization, sort it by confidence. What are your top hits? What about if you sort by taxon? What hits do you see?
# When sorted by the confidence there are two unassigned and when done again you can see the most being a top hit of k__Bacteria; p__Proteobacteria; c__Alphaproteobacteria; o__Sphingomonadales; f__Sphingomonadaceae; g__Sphingomonas; s__
# When sorted by the taxa the unassigned had the most hits and the least hits were the k__Archaea; p__Crenarchaeota; c__Thaumarchaeota; o__Nitrososphaerales; f__Nitrososphaeraceae; g__Candidatus Nitrososphaera; s__gargensis

5) When you visualize level 3 of taxonomy, what level is this? Do you see any trends as you sort by various metadata categories?
# Most of them seem to be labeled as just bacteria.

6) After visualizing your filtered-table.qzv, what cutoff value will you use for generating alpha and beta diversity? Why? Include a screenshot of the interactive sample view to help justify your reasoning. 
# The number I used was 8,702 since anything lower than the 10,000 can be considered to be low quality data. You want to use a value thats small enough to include the majority of the data but not too large to cut off too many of the values that can be used.

7) The first metric we will analyze is alpha diversity. In your own words, what is alpha diversity and what are the differences between the two types of alpha diversity we will analyze (Shannon and Observed features)?
# Alpha diversity looks into the data for the whole ecosystem and the beta diversity uses data too look at a community. The difference is Shannon uses the data for a community and measures it while the Observed uses the measuring for a microbiome but more qualitatively. 

8) Since you are looking at two metrics of diversity for 3 metadata categories, it would be helpful to make a table of the significance values. Are any of your comparisons significant? For one of the metadata data columns, there are actually 4 options. Include a screenshot of the pairwise comparisons for Shannon and Observed. Are there any significant comparisons? (HINT: look at the q value)
There were not any significant comparisons between any of the groups. The easiest way to look at it was to view the values with the table for all the groups. Since all of the data showed that all groups had higher values than 0.05 we simply interpret it as having no significant difference. 

10) For beta diversity, you will need to create visualizations for Bray Curtis dissimilarity and Weighted Unifrac distance. This will require your to modify the beta-group-significance code. You should have one visualization for each metadata column you are interested in. Include a screenshot of each visualization. Is there any significance? Regardless of significance, how can you interpret these results (hint: what is beta diversity looking at?) How are Bray Curtis dissimilarity and Weighted Unifrac distance different?
Weighted Unifrac usually clusters similar or close similar relative as being the same and Bray Curtis doesn't do this. Yet they both look at community distributions. Looking at all the pvalues you can see that they are under the 0.05 value rang which means that within the communities there is a difference. 

11) The core-metrics-phylogeny command generates a file called bray-curtis-emporer.qzv. Include 3 screenshots total (where the points are colored based on the metadata metrics). How do these results help you make sense of the results you got from question 10?
Since the bray-Curtis dissimilarity doesn't count for certain difference between communities you can see that with less data the chart can be viewed as skewed. The resolve would be to get more better data for the calculation. 

12) Using ANCOMBC, do you find any specific taxa that are differentially expressed with your three metadata categories? Please include a screenshot of any differentially expressed taxa and identify the species using the taxonomy.qzv file.
